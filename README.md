## Dijkstra Path Finding Algorithm Visualizer
Welcome to Path Finding Visualizer!

This application supports and visualizes the **Dijkstra's Algorithm** (weighted) on an MxN Grid.

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

`About the Algorithm:`

It is a type of *Greedy Algorithm* used for finding the shortest path between nodes in a given weighted graph.

The time complexity of Dijkstra's Algorithm is **O((V + E) log V)** with the help of an adjacency list representation of the graph, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.
